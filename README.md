# Automatic-Parking-Space-Detection
informed the space quantity &amp; data of parking
Objectives of the project
Develop an efficient algorithm to accurately detect the presence or absence of vehicles in parking spaces.

Implement a system that can differentiate between occupied and unoccupied parking spaces in real-time.

Design a solution capable of detecting vehicles of various shapes, sizes, and colors under different lighting conditions.

Explore techniques to improve the accuracy and robustness of parking space detection.

Develop algorithms to track the occupancy status of individual parking spaces over time.

Requirement of the Project:
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)
NUMPY library
Pickle Module
CarparkingPos file 
CarParking Mp4 video and image
